# WordSearch CLI  
A fast and customizable command-line tool for searching English words by prefix.  
Built for games like **Last Letter**, word puzzles, linguistics tools, and general word lookup.

This CLI loads a local `words_dictionary.json` (400k+ words) and performs instant prefix searches using an optimized binary-search algorithm.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The CLI loads a dictionary and performs:

- Pre-sorting of all words (case-insensitive)

- Binary lower-bound prefix lookup

- Sequential collection of all matching words

- Optional table-format rendering

- Field truncation and column fitting

I made it because I needed it and for fun. Maybe you need it too.

A simple & fast CLI to dominate any word-based challenge.
